"# MCU-project" 
A microcontroller based on MIPS Pipeline core, including GPIO, Timer module, and Interrupt Handler. This is a VHDL Project implemented on Altera FPGA SOC.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive example of designing a MIPS-based system with basic I/O, timing, and interrupt functionalities.
The microcontroller is integrated with components for GPIO interfacing using LEDs and HEX displays as outputs, switches as inputs, a basic timer unit with PWM and interrupt generation, and an interrupt handler to facilitate communication between the CPU and the peripherals. 


Components:
* MIPS Pipeline CPU
  The MIPS pipeline CPU is a multi-stage architecture that optimizes instruction execution by breaking it into several       
  stages, including Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).   This component is responsible for executing MIPS assembly instructions fetched from instruction memory. The core also        contains data cache memory of 2KB and a register file containing 32 registers of 32 bits each.
  The core is capable of accssesing the microcontroller's peripherials components via a specific address for each component.


* Interrupt Handler
  The interrupt handler manages interrupts generated by the timer unit and external push buttons. It interacts with the     
  CPU's interrupt enable (IE) and interrupt flag (IFG) registers. If the Global Interrupt Enable (GIE) flag is set in the IE 
  register, and an interrupt condition is met (such as a timer compare match or a push button press), the handler generates 
  an interrupt signal (INTR) that prompts the CPU to jump to the specified memory address (PC of mem[type]).

* Timer Unit
  The timer unit is composed of the Basic Timer Control and Clock Registers (BTCCR0, BTCCR1, BTCTL) and generates a PWM        signal. The BTCCR0 and BTCCR1 registers set the timer period and compare value respectively, while the BTCTL register        configures timer settings. The timer also generates an interrupt when the timer reaches the compare value, indicated by 
  the Basic Timer Interrupt Flag (BTIFG).

* GPIO Interface
  The GPIO interface controls LEDs and HEX displays for output and reads switches for input. LEDs and HEX displays can be      configured to display specific patterns or values, and switches can be monitored for changes in their states.
